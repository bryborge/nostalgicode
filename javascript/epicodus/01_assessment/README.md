###Purpose
This is the first assessment in the JavaScript curriculum at Epicodus.  It seeks to teach students the basics of vanilla JavaScript and the Chai and Mocha JavaScript testing frameworks, while reinforcing Behavior Driven Development (BDD) practices learned in the PHP curriculum.

###Description
This app takes three arguments from the user (the length of the sides of a triangle) and it returns what kind of triangle it is (equilateral, isosceles, or scalene).  It will also tell the user if the triangle described is a valid triangle, based on the Triangle Equality Theorem.
