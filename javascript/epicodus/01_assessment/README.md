# Triangle Checker

## Purpose

This is the first assessment in the JavaScript curriculum at Epicodus.  It seeks
to teach students the basics of vanilla JavaScript and the Chai and Mocha
JavaScript testing frameworks, while reinforcing Behavior Driven Development
(BDD) practices learned in the PHP curriculum.

## Description

This app takes three arguments from the user (the length of the sides of a
triangle) and it returns what kind of triangle it is (equilateral, isosceles,
or scalene). It will also tell the user if the triangle described is a valid
triangle, based on the Triangle Equality Theorem.

## Use and Editing

1. Cloning this project to the directory of your choice
1. Opening the project in your favorite text-editor (optional)
