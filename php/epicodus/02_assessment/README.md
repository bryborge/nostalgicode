###Purpose
This is the second assessment in the PHP Curriculum at Epicodus. It seeks to help students solidify concepts in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and app testing, and to reinforce the concepts covered in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with PHP covered in the previous week.

###Description
Word Redundancy Checker is an app which allows a user to enter a string of words and a single word they would like to count in the string.  When the form is submitted, the user is told how many times the word being searched for showed up in the search.

###Use and Editing
To use this app, simply: <br />
1. Download and Extract the compressed file into the directory you'd like your project to live in. <br />
2. Load the project folder into your text editor. <br />
3. Start PHP in the web folder of the project directory. <br />
4. Open up your browser and point it to the location of php (ex: localhost:8000) <br />
5. Search to your heart's content! <br />
*if you have issues, try deleting the vendor folder (and its contents) as well as the compose.lock file, then open terminal and run composer install*
