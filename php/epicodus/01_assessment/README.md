# Frenemy - the (anti)revolutionary contact manager

Frenemy is a simple address book application written in PHP and uses the Silex
microframework as well as the template engine Twig.

## Purpose

This is the first Object-Oriented PHP Assessment in the Epicodus curriculum. It
seeks to help students solidify the concept of the Model-View-Controller design
pattern and reinforce a rudimentary understanding of application development in
PHP.

## Description

This application allows users to fill out a form to submit a contact to their
address book. The contact object stores the contact's name, phone number,
mailing address, and a URL to an image of the contact. Once submitted, the user
can see the contact objects stored in a column on the right-hand side of the
app's main page. Finally, the user can delete all of the contacts in the address
book by simply clicking the 'Delete All' button.

## Setup Instructions

1. Download the project file and unpack it.
1. Start PHP in the project's web directory.
1. Open it in your browser, and use to your heart's content!

*ex: if you started PHP in the projects web directory and chose localhost for
the address and 8000 for the port, navigate to localhost:8000 in the URL bar of
your browser*
