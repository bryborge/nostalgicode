### Purpose

This is the first Object-Oriented PHP Assessment in the Epicodus curriculum.  It seeks to help students solidify the concept of the Model-View-Controller design pattern and reinforce a rudimentary understanding of application development in PHP.


### Description

This application allows users to fill out a form to submit a contact to their address book. The contact object stores the contact's name, phone number, mailing address, and a URL to an image of the contact.  Once submitted, the user can see the contact objects stored in a column on the right-hand side of the app's main page.  Finally, the user can delete all of the contacts in the address book by simply clicking the 'Delete All' button.


### Setup Instructions

1) Download the project file and unpack it.<br />
2) Start PHP in the project's web directory.<br />
3) Open it in your browser, and use to your heart's content!<br />
    *ex: if you started PHP in the projects web directory and chose localhost for the address and 8000 for the port, navigate to localhost:8000 in the URL bar of your browser*
