# Epicodus PHP

This class was a life-changing experience. The cohort was comprised of the most
wonderful and diverse people. I'll never forget the way the air buzzed with
the excitement and friendly chatter of my peers as we worked through the day's
problem sets. A whirlwind of mental focus, food carts, caffeine, and friendship.
